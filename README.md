# RoadObjectsDetection

This pet project focuses on utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture for real-time object detection on roadways. The primary goal is to enhance road safety and improve navigation systems by accurately identifying various objects.

The system will detect the following key elements:

1. Traffic Signs: The model will identify and classify various traffic signs, facilitating better understanding and compliance with road regulations.

2. Pedestrians: By detecting pedestrians in real-time, this project aims to improve the safety of both pedestrians and drivers, reducing the likelihood of accidents.

3. Vehicles: The detection of cars, trucks, and other vehicles will help in analyzing traffic patterns and ensuring smooth vehicular flow.

By employing YOLO for object detection, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring road environments, ultimately contributing to enhanced safety and efficiency in transportation systems. 

The integration of these detection capabilities can find applications in various areas such as autonomous driving, smart traffic management systems, and enhancing overall road safety measures.
